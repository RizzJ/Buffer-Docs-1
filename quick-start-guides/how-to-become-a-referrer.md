# How to become a Referrer?

## Step 1: Getting Started

If this is your first time on https://app.buffer.finance/, before you start placing up/down trades, follow the "Getting started" that will help you with connecting to the dApp, and preparing your wallet with sufficient ETH for gas among other pre-requisites.

## Step 2: Create a referral code

To participate in the referral program, first, you need to create a referral code. To do that, navigate to https://app.buffer.finance/#/referral.

Click on  **'Create your Referral'** and enter any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores to create a referral code. Click on **'Create'**.

_Note that referral codes are case-sensitive and that your code must be created on both Arbitrum as well as Polygon to earn trader rewards on both networks._

Once the referral code is successfully created,  click on the copy icon next to the code to get your referral link, it should look something like this: https://app.buffer.finance/#/?ref='your_code_here'.

Once copied, you can share your referral link on any social media or communication platform. When a user clicks on your link, your referral code will be connected to their account. When a user (referee) under your referral network, makes a trade they will receive a payout boost depending on their tier and you (referer) will receive trader rewards on the referee's trade size. 

When the user makes a trade they would receive a discount and you would earn rebates from their trading fees. You will continue to earn rebates even if the user uses another device later on as the referral code is stored on the contract the first time the user makes a trade.

You can track your overall rebate history including 'trading volume,' 'Total Referred Trades,' and 'Total Rebates Earned.'

_Note: referee rewards and referer rewards are distributed in USDC both on Arbitrum and Polygon.

To understand referral tiers and rewards, use the 'Referrals' page under the 'Rewards' section.
